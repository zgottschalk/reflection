Today I updated my website . it looks amazing. I created links to other ebsites I made. It was hard to fix my mistake, because it wasn't easy to find most of my codes. In all I feel that It was full of rewards. I made a whole shopping Website with lots of content. I found it interesting to learn codes like <input> which puts a webpage inside your webpage. I also had fun with adding extra details like, coloring, moving paragraphs, and changeing fonts! Some parts of the website were very hard to perfect, because I kept messing up on some of the single letter/ symbol codes. This caused it to ruin or not work properly. I couldn't figure out how to add images so I almost stopped working with images and then I refreshed the page and it was working.

I have learned about CSS coding and how to make a website with it. I also learned that it's slow but rewarding. It is also iteresting to figure out my mistakes aand fix them. The most annoying part is know when and where to insert your codes. These mistakes can be drastic or even unfixable. I was very fustrated until I fixed it.
