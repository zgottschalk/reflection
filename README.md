Today I made a iteractive pokemon intro. most of my mistakes were about the simplest of details. The codes were not in python format which caused so many errors. we also learned about lists and how to used by almost all programmers. It makes so much more sence now that I know what I'm doing. I also learned that putting a # can make the computer ignore the line of code it is place in. It is important that You don't overuse #'s because it can ruin your codes and program.

Today I learned how to work with python and its coding language. It is difficult to spot mistakes. It was hard to reach my goals but I figured it out at the last ten minutes. Its mostly used for programing rather than website building. I spent all night working on my coding and it payed off in class even though I struggled with it. There are variables in python just like math. It can be broken and can also figure out complex math problems. We programed a interactive program asking for names and responses# reflection

Today I updated my website . it looks amazing. I created links to other ebsites I made. It was hard to fix my mistake, because it wasn't easy to find most of my codes. In all I feel that It was full of rewards. I made a whole shopping Website with lots of content. I found it interesting to learn codes like <input> which puts a webpage inside your webpage. I also had fun with adding extra details like, coloring, moving paragraphs, and changeing fonts! Some parts of the website were very hard to perfect, because I kept messing up on some of the single letter/ symbol codes. This caused it to ruin or not work properly. I couldn't figure out how to add images so I almost stopped working with images and then I refreshed the page and it was working.

The most annoying part is know when and where to insert your codes. These mistakes can be drastic or even unfixable. I was very fustrated until I fixed it.
