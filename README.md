Today we started on our games on pygame. pygame is such a easy to use program its acctually surprising. It is a lot of fun and since i now know more about coding i can learn more and complete tasks much more easily. Im thinking of making a game where you have to dodge falling boulders and apps/emojis. I changed the backround to a image and changed my characters clothes. It still needs a lot more work to work properly. I learned about sprites and how they contribute to my code.

  I learned about quantum computing and that it can work out super hard problems like getting the closest degree to absolut zero. It came up with 0.015 K! I also got a bit farther on the codeacademy python class.

Today I completed my military time program and turned numbers counting down to numbers counting up. Now that was fustrating but very rewarding. I also learned about looping. Looping can make codes repeat for internity or by pressing control c.

Today I took so much time and effort to solve a problem and I still couldn't solve it. It was about creating a looping program that you can interact with. It was absolutely infuriating! The feeling of not solveing a problem is very sad and makes you feel incapable of succeed in life. We also learned about fiberoptic.

  I finally got further in my dots and boxes program wchich was soooo hard to do. I also learned more about loops and how to use them. I also learned that you can't fool Mr. Gold. I also learned how to use varios variables to not confuse python. This can be a problem if you have bad variable names. It can affect you later on making your code much more complicated.
